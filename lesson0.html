  <h1 id="lesson-0---introduction">Lesson 0 - Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to the workshop! This introduction serves to explore why this workshop exists, the tools we are exploring, the schedule, goals, and some general tips to keep in mind throughout the month. At the bottom is an assignment to get you acquainted with the Discord server.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>I really love programming, but it was not always this way. Colleges seem to think that the best way to introduce programming is through making projects that output text to a console. Overwhelming amounts of online resources contradict each other saying X or Y is the only right way to learn coding. Learning the fundamentals without making interesting projects can feel boring and meaningless.</p>
<p>This workshop is an attempt to introduce programming in the way that I wish it was introduced to me: making rad things with inspirational tools.</p>
<h2 id="the-tools">The tools</h2>
<h3 id="p5.js">p5.js</h3>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/502135348663578624/-oslcYof.png" alt="p5 image"><br>
This tool is best described by the first paragraph of its <a href="https://p5js.org/">website</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being written in JavaScript allows p5.js to work natively in the web browser. The <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/">p5.js web editor</a> allows anyone to start coding complex graphical programs without the need to have anything downloaded, installed, or setup besides a web browser.</p>
<h3 id="raylib">raylib</h3>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Raylib_logo.png" alt="raylib image"><br>
Being written in C, <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a> is a great tool to learn the fundamentals of programming with. C, unlike JavaScript, is a relatively small language without a lot of features.</p>
<p>However, like p5.js, raylib makes it very fast and easy to see the results of your code. With one line of code you can start a window and with another you can draw a shape in it.</p>
<h3 id="godot">Godot</h3>
<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/themes/godotengine/assets/download/godot_logo.svg" alt="Godot Image"><br>
Surpassing the users of successful commercial game engines like GameMaker and approaching the users of Unity, <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> is the dark horse of the game engine world.</p>
<p>Unlike its competitors, it is completely free. Games you make with it are completely owned by you. Like p5.js and raylib, the code for Godot is open source and contributed to by users of the tool.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-schedule">Lesson Schedule</h2>
<p>Each week will have its own theme. Lessons will be released each Monday and Friday. They will contain examples with explanations, an exercise where you choose your own difficulty level, and resources to continue with self-learning beyond the lesson.</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1: p5.js</li>
<li>Week 2: raylib</li>
<li>Week 3: Godot</li>
<li>Week 4: Make and publish a game!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>While a month is a very short amount of time to develop any kind of expertise, there are a few goals that are totally feasible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn how to learn</strong>: Know how to apporach whatever project you dream up.</li>
<li><strong>Develop a genuine interest</strong>: Find inspiration in the tools, languages, and work of others.</li>
<li><strong>Make and publish a game</strong>: Finish a game, however small, and host it on <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a> for others to play!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-tips">General Tips</h2>
<h3 id="expectations">Expectations</h3>
<p>Many people have preconceptions about what programming is, but with little to no experience these preconceptions are often wrong. Expectations can be demotivating when we are not making progress as fast as we would like or when the experience is not like what we imagined. By keeping an open mind and being present in the experience of learning you can avoid the pitfalls of expectations and truly enjoy programming.</p>
<h3 id="problem-solving">Problem Solving</h3>
<p>Programming really is just problem solving at its core. When you find problems perfectly suited for your skill level things will become the most interesting and you will be the most engaged. There are two problem solving strategies that will be very useful for this workshop:</p>
<li><strong>Analytical Approach</strong>: When a problem seems too complex, break it down into smaller more manageable parts. E.g. If making a collectible coin for your game, break into down into the steps: 1. check if player is touching the coin 2. remove coin 3. increment coin count.</li>
<li><strong>Timeboxing</strong>: It is very easy to become stubborn and burn yourself out over implementing a certain feature. With timeboxing you avoid this by allocating a fixed time period to a planned activity. If you do not complete it in that time, then you take a break, move on, or ask for help.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>If you share your progress, ask questions, and answer questions, you will be much more engaged in the workshop. You all have similar goals and skill levels! Seeing people similar to you succeed will be very motivating, so helping others will also be helping yourself. While this workshop could easily be a done on your own time at your own pace, the community aspect of doing it alongside others adds a huge amount of potential.</p>
