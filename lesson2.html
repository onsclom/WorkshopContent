    <p>In lesson 1 we discussed the basics of programming and p5.js. This lesson will explore the world of creative coding, the utility of JavaScript, and reference a tutorial for creating our first p5.js game.</p>
    <h2 id="creative-coding">Creative Coding</h2>
    <p>Something that is really worth exploring is creative coding. Creating coding takes programming and turns it into a medium for art. While it is worth exploring for its own intrinsic value, creative coding also has many parallels in skills with game development. Creative coding, game development, and more general programming are all so closely related that improving at one will also improve you at the others.</p>
    <p>I was first introduced to creative coding with <a href="https://twitter.com/beesandbombs">beesandbombs</a> on twitter. All of his gifs are made with p6.js and Java’s Processing (where p5.js originated from). Perhaps you have already seen his work in the <a href="https://twitter.com/beesandbombs/status/1326317836848009217">ending credits of Queen’s Gambit</a>. Twitter has a great community of creative coders and by following some rad people like him, your feed will be filled with inspiration to create your own things.</p>
    <p>Creative coding is just one example of the many amazing rabbit holes you can just get lost in with the world of programming. If it interests you, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding">check out the history of creative coding</a>, try recreating some of the interesting stuff you find, or brainstorm and start your own piece of art. Lastly, I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://codecember.ink/">codecember</a> by Pine Wu and Anthony Fu. For each day of December, they created creative coding challenges with inspiring examples and references.</p>
    <h2 id="the-utility-of-javascript">The Utility of JavaScript</h3>
    <p>Now let us explore the versatility that comes with writing games and other programs with p5.js. Being written in JavaScript allows things you write to be ran natively in browsers. Web pages are simply a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so embedding a p5.js project into a larger website is no problem.  Check out <a href="http://beesandbombs.com/">beesandbomb’s personal website</a> which embeds a p5.js sketch in the background or check out <a href="https://itch.io/games/made-with-p5js">itch.io’s top games made with p5.js</a> which are all playable in the browser without any downloading or installing necessary.</p>
    <p>But perhaps you want your game or project to be a standalone desktop application… Well you are covered there too! <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> allows you to easily convert HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a standalone project. Discord Desktop uses Electron for example! Since JavaScript is such a popular language, there are tons of open source tools available to you like Electron for helping with whatever your project requires.</p>
    <h2 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h2>
    <p>It is time to make our first game in p5.js! Following with the trend of referencing the great documentation that already exists, I found this amazing <a href="https://kellylougheed.medium.com/make-your-first-game-with-p5-js-38bfb308a671">tutorial for creating your first game with p5.js</a> by Kelly Lougheed. In less than 15 minutes you will have made a totally interactive whack-a-mole/aim trainer game from scratch. If you have not already, you will learn how to use variables and how to interact with user input. As an added bonus, it even covers some strategies for refactoring and organizing your code.</p>
    <p>If you have more time, add on to the game! Kelly gives some suggestions at the end and perhaps you can come up with some of your own ideas. Like last lesson, share your progress in the server upon completing the exercise.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This lesson may seem pretty short and haphazard, but in part that is by design. It is important to remember our original goals from Lesson 0: learn how to learn, develop a genuine interest, and make your own game. While structured step by step tutorials are great for accomplishing very narrowly defined tasks, our goals are much more broad. This will be the last lesson with p5.js as with Monday’s lesson we will begin exploring <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a>.</p>
